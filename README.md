This is a simple project.

Can you write a small python script to:

1. Load the GJB2.markers.tsv tabular file
2. Filter the rows of the file on the MAX-AF column (col 5) in order to keep rows where the MAX-AF value is greater than 0.01
3. Write out all non-filtered rows into a new file. 
4. Add your script and parsed output file to the git repository
